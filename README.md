# C++ Calculator Test
Every time I learn a new language, there's one program that I write to get a handle on typing, I/O, etc., and that's a calculator. C++ is no exception.

It just so happens that I *really* do not like writing code in C++. It's awkward, it's unintuitive, and it's not very fun. That said, this repo contains the world's worst fucking calculator. Enjoy!
